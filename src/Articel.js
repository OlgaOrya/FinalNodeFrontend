        <p> Diabetes gets a lot of attention these days, and for good reason: it can lead to serious health complications 
        such as heart attack, kidney failure, amputation, blindness, and early death. But its precursor, aptly named
        prediabetes, doesn’t get nearly as much airtime, despite affecting three times as many people.
        One in three American adults — an estimated 96 million people — has prediabetes, which is characterized 
        by blood sugar levels that are higher than the normal range but don’t quite reach diabetes status. 
        But the vast majority of people don’t know when they have it. And this is where the danger 
        and opportunity — lie, Harvard experts say.
        "As with every chronic, prevalent disease, it’s incredibly important to understand who’s at particularly
        high risk of progressing from prediabetes to diabetes," says Dr. Giulio Romeo, associate medical director 
        of the Adult Diabetes Section at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center.</p>

        <p>Unlike diabetes, prediabetes is "largely silent" and typically doesn’t produce blatant symptoms that might
        clue us in to its presence, Dr. Romeo says. But subtler signs often show up that shouldn’t be ignored, offering 
        a valuable window to curb blood sugar levels and halt progression.
        "Anyone whose blood sugar falls into the prediabetes range is going in only one direction unless changes 
        are made," says Emma Samuels Grinblatas, a registered dietitian and practice manager in the Comprehensive 
        Weight Management Center at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        "Genetic and lifestyle factors both play a role in the development of diabetes. Whether we like it or not, 
        our bodies will behave in certain ways. We don’t get to play with our genes, but we do get to make changes 
        in our eating behaviors and lifestyle choices."</p>
